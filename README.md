# Power-BI-Projects
Bank Marketing EDA & Dashboarding Project

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and interactive dashboarding.
The objective was to uncover insights that drive term deposit subscription rates, optimize campaign strategies, and recommend improvements for targeted marketing.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
	â€¢	Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Bank Marketing Dataset
	â€¢	Records: 45,000+ entries
	â€¢	Features: Demographics, call campaign details, economic indicators, and customer subscription outcomes.

# ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
	â€¢	Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (data cleaning & EDA)
	â€¢	Power BI: Interactive dashboards (slicers, drill-throughs, KPI cards, customer segmentation)

ðŸ”‘ Key Steps
	1.	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	â€¢	Handled missing values & outliers
	â€¢	Encoded categorical variables
	â€¢	Scaled and transformed features
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	â€¢	Histograms, box plots, and bar charts
	â€¢	Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships
	â€¢	Factors driving term-deposit subscription
	3.	Dashboarding
	â€¢	Built Power BI dashboard with:
	â€¢	Customer segmentation (age, job, marital status)
	â€¢	Campaign performance (call duration, number of contacts, outcomes)
	â€¢	Drill-throughs & slicers for interactivity
	â€¢	KPI cards for quick insights
	4.	Recommendations
	â€¢	Targeted campaigns toward specific demographics (e.g., older age groups, certain job categories)
	â€¢	Focus on call duration strategy to increase conversions
	â€¢	Segment customers based on past contact history

ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Findings
	â€¢	Longer call durations correlated strongly with higher conversion rates.
	â€¢	Education and job type were significant predictors of term-deposit subscriptions.
	â€¢	Customers with fewer previous contacts were more likely to respond positively.

ðŸ“‚ Project Files
	â€¢	Banking Dashboard.pbix â†’ Power BI dashboard file
	â€¢	bank_marketing_EDA.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing & EDA (if you have it, else remove)
	â€¢	Screenshots folder â†’ Visuals of dashboard & plots
