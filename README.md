ðŸ“Š Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Project Background

This project explores the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset (45,000+ records) to identify factors influencing term-deposit subscriptions and improve marketing strategies.
The analysis combines Python-based EDA with an interactive Power BI dashboard to deliver actionable insights.

â¸»

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
	â€¢	Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA, preprocessing)
	â€¢	Power BI: Interactive dashboards (slicers, drill-throughs, KPI cards)

â¸»

ðŸ”‘ Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	â€¢	Handled missing values & outliers
	â€¢	Encoded categorical variables
	â€¢	Scaled & transformed features

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	â€¢	Histograms, box plots, and bar charts
	â€¢	Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships
	â€¢	Feature analysis for subscription outcomes

3. Dashboard Development
	â€¢	Customer segmentation (age, job, marital status)
	â€¢	Campaign performance (call duration, contacts, outcomes)
	â€¢	KPI cards for quick insights
	â€¢	Drill-throughs & slicers for interactivity

4. Recommendations
	â€¢	Target specific demographics (older groups, certain jobs)
	â€¢	Focus on call duration strategy (3â€“6 mins ideal)
	â€¢	Avoid over-contacting customers
	â€¢	Segment customers by past campaign history

â¸»

ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Findings
	â€¢	Call duration is the strongest predictor of subscription success.
	â€¢	Education and job type significantly impact conversion rates.
	â€¢	Customers with fewer previous contacts are more likely to respond positively.
